# Little Orion

Little Orion is a 4X space strategy game tailored for iOS. 
It's vastly insprired from Stellaris and Master of Orion. 

My goal while writing this game is mainly to learn SpriteKit, GameplayKit and SceneKit frameworks from Apple. 

It's wrote in Swift 4, use all of the latest iOS technologies. It's also using the Redux pattern as a backend. So most of the state machine from GameplayKit is not used here. It havr its own state machine and events bus instead.

So for the time being, Little Orion will be iOS only. Once it'll be good enough, I might port it to Unity.
